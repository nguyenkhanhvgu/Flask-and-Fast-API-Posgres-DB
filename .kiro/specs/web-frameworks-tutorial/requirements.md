# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This project aims to create a comprehensive tutorial platform that teaches web development using Flask, FastAPI, and PostgreSQL from basic concepts to advanced implementations. The tutorial will be structured as an interactive learning experience with practical examples, exercises, and progressive skill building across all three technologies.

## Requirements

**User Story:** As a beginner developer, I want to learn Flask fundamentals, so that I can build basic web applications with Python.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the Flask basics section THEN the system SHALL provide step-by-step tutorials covering routing, templates, and request handling
2. WHEN a user completes a Flask exercise THEN the system SHALL validate their code and provide feedback
3. WHEN a user progresses through Flask lessons THEN the system SHALL track their completion status
4. IF a user encounters errors in Flask code THEN the system SHALL provide debugging guidance and common solutions

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer learning Flask, I want to understand advanced Flask concepts, so that I can build production-ready applications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user reaches advanced Flask topics THEN the system SHALL cover blueprints, application factories, and configuration management
2. WHEN a user studies Flask security THEN the system SHALL demonstrate authentication, authorization, and CSRF protection
3. WHEN a user learns Flask testing THEN the system SHALL provide examples of unit tests, integration tests, and test fixtures
4. WHEN a user explores Flask deployment THEN the system SHALL show containerization and production deployment strategies

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to learn FastAPI fundamentals, so that I can build modern API applications with automatic documentation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user starts FastAPI lessons THEN the system SHALL explain async programming concepts and type hints
2. WHEN a user creates FastAPI endpoints THEN the system SHALL demonstrate automatic OpenAPI documentation generation
3. WHEN a user implements data validation THEN the system SHALL show Pydantic models and request/response schemas
4. WHEN a user handles errors in FastAPI THEN the system SHALL provide exception handling patterns and HTTP status codes

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer learning FastAPI, I want to master advanced FastAPI features, so that I can build scalable and maintainable APIs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user studies advanced FastAPI THEN the system SHALL cover dependency injection, middleware, and background tasks
2. WHEN a user implements authentication THEN the system SHALL demonstrate OAuth2, JWT tokens, and security schemes
3. WHEN a user optimizes FastAPI applications THEN the system SHALL show performance tuning and async best practices
4. WHEN a user tests FastAPI applications THEN the system SHALL provide testing strategies with pytest and test clients

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to learn PostgreSQL fundamentals, so that I can design and manage relational databases effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user begins PostgreSQL lessons THEN the system SHALL cover database installation, basic SQL operations, and data types
2. WHEN a user designs database schemas THEN the system SHALL demonstrate table creation, relationships, and constraints
3. WHEN a user queries data THEN the system SHALL provide examples of SELECT statements, joins, and aggregations
4. WHEN a user manages data THEN the system SHALL show INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE operations and transaction handling

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer learning PostgreSQL, I want to understand advanced database concepts, so that I can optimize and maintain production databases.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user studies advanced PostgreSQL THEN the system SHALL cover indexing strategies, query optimization, and performance tuning
2. WHEN a user implements database security THEN the system SHALL demonstrate user management, roles, and permissions
3. WHEN a user handles database operations THEN the system SHALL show stored procedures, triggers, and views
4. WHEN a user manages database maintenance THEN the system SHALL provide backup, recovery, and monitoring techniques

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to integrate Flask/FastAPI with PostgreSQL, so that I can build full-stack web applications with persistent data storage.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user connects frameworks to PostgreSQL THEN the system SHALL demonstrate database connection setup and ORM usage
2. WHEN a user implements CRUD operations THEN the system SHALL show database interactions through both Flask and FastAPI
3. WHEN a user handles database migrations THEN the system SHALL provide schema evolution and version control strategies
4. WHEN a user optimizes database queries THEN the system SHALL demonstrate connection pooling and query optimization techniques

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a learner, I want interactive coding exercises and projects, so that I can practice and reinforce my understanding of the concepts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user completes a lesson THEN the system SHALL provide hands-on coding exercises related to the topic
2. WHEN a user submits exercise solutions THEN the system SHALL validate code correctness and provide feedback
3. WHEN a user progresses through modules THEN the system SHALL offer progressive projects that combine multiple concepts
4. WHEN a user encounters difficulties THEN the system SHALL provide hints, solutions, and additional resources

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a learner, I want to track my progress and access reference materials, so that I can monitor my learning journey and quickly find information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the platform THEN the system SHALL display their current progress across all modules
2. WHEN a user completes lessons or exercises THEN the system SHALL update their progress indicators and unlock new content
3. WHEN a user needs reference information THEN the system SHALL provide searchable documentation and code examples
4. WHEN a user wants to review concepts THEN the system SHALL offer quick reference guides and cheat sheets

### Requirement 10

**User Story:** As a learner, I want the tutorial content to be well-organized and accessible, so that I can learn efficiently and find information easily.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user navigates the platform THEN the system SHALL provide clear learning paths from beginner to advanced levels
2. WHEN a user searches for content THEN the system SHALL return relevant lessons, exercises, and reference materials
3. WHEN a user accesses content on different devices THEN the system SHALL provide a responsive and consistent experience
4. WHEN a user bookmarks content THEN the system SHALL allow them to save and organize their favorite resources
